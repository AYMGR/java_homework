 * 2.10 (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat
 * water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to
 * enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. The
 * formula to compute the energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184 where M
 * is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and
 * energy Q is measured in joules. Here is a sample run: Enter the amount of water in kilograms:
 * 55.5 Enter the initial temperature: 3.5 Enter the final temperature: 10.5 The energy needed is
 * 1625484.0
