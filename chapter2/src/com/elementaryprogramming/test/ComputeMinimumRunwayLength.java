 *  2.12 (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v,
 *  you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:
 *                                    length = v^2 / 2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration
 * a in meters/second squared (m/s2), then, displays the minimum runway length.
 * Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
 *            The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
